        <p>Jenn has taken over our three publications, the Apache CouchDB Weekly News, the Hoodie and the Offline First monthly newsletters, from an existing team earlier this year. She was up and running producing high quality editions within the first week. We are very happy with her work and continue to be impressed with the speed, quality, professionalism, and whimsy of Jenn’s publication work.</p>
